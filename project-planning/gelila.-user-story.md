hey guys here is some of my ideas......

## Volunteers xChange Box

## (VoxBox)

## About

VoxBox is a platform that will assist people who need help to link with volunteers.

The aim is to create easy and accessible website (app) for anyone that is in need of help and for individuals who are offering the help.

The goal of the platform is to have safe and reliable space for both sides to meet and help one another free of charge.

## The concept

**People who are looking for help** : can register as help seeker and search for a volunteers by specifying the kind of help they need and when they need it

By doing so, they will be presented with volunteers that match the specification based on their Geo-location. The provided information will be the volunteers' profile...

**For Individuals who are offering help** : can register as a volunteer by giving a basic information to the site (name, address, available time, phone number‚Ä¶.(&amp; may be a picture)). Following there registration they will become part of VoxBox and will be available for help based on their available time.

## User interaction

The site should be accessible,easy and simple to use for everyone.

Landing page:

- This page should offer some information about VoxBox and what it stands for‚Ä¶
- There should be two buttons asking the user as who they want to register. (seeking help or offering help) . After specifying their role, they can be redirected to a registration form.

A registration form:

- Inputs: username, Address, phone No., password and or picture with sign-up button
- If the user doesn&#39;t want to register there should be a choice for them to go back to home page..(it can be addressed with navigation bar)

After registration:

- The user can see a thank you and welcome message box(or site) with a button that will prompt them to sign-in
- By clicking the sign-in button they will be ask to provide username and password.

After signing-in

**People who are looking for help\*\*** :\*\*

**Option1**

will be asked a series of question

1. What kind of help are you looking for ‚Ä¶next
2. When do you need the help‚Ä¶.

Based on their Gio-location they provided by registering, they will get volunteers info that match the requested help and available time.

**Option2**

After signing-in, strait away the user can be provided with an information on how many volunteers are around their area.(&#39;we have found 15 volunteers around your area. Please give us more information to offer you the best matches&#39;(something like that üòä)) .

**For Individuals who are offering help** :

When signing in, they will be asked:

1. Please tell us about your self
2. what kind of volunteer service would you like to be part of?
3. What is the best time for you to volunteer?

Based on the information above the user can have some kind of profile ‚Ä¶

This are some ideas that I have(I know it&#39;s a bit long sorry üôá‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è ) please feel free to edit or comment under and let me know if its ridiculous üôÑ üòÖ
